Or, call your NHPD district manager.  By reporting where these cars ATV and dirt bikes are stored, your district manager can build a case for getting a search warrant and eventually they will be able to confiscate the machines.  But, first they need to build a case.  They need to gather evidence.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the Edgewood/Dwight Neighborhood it is Sgt. Steve Torquati at (203) 946-7597.  In the Whalley, Edgewood, Beaver Hills (WEB) Neighborhood it is Lt. Makiem Miller at (203) 589-3318 or mmiller@newhavenct.net. They will investigate and can confiscate the vehicles.\r\n\r\nYou can also contact your LCI neighborhood specialist.  In Edgewood/Dwight, contact Tracy Claxton at (203) 946-2857 or TClaxton@newhavenct.net.\r\n\r\nThen, contact your alderman to put pressure on the city to make this issue a priority for the police. The Edgewood ward is ward 24: call Evette Hamilton at (203) 508-5426 orWard24@newhavenct.net.\r\n\r\nTo find the NHPD district manager, LCI representative, district management team chairperson and know when your neighborhood meetings are held see:\r\n http://www.cityofnewhaven.com/uploads/neighborhood%20specialist%20and%20LT_updatedMARCH_2015(1).xls\r\n\r\nHere is the list of Aldermen by Ward:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cityofnewhaven.com/aldermen/index.asp\r\n\r\nIf you want IMMEDIATE action, call the non-emergency (dispatch) NHPD phone number at 203-946-6316.  Tell the dispatcher that your district manager (use their name) said to call and have some patrols sent to your area.  Then ask the responding officer to CALL YOU BACK.  This is very important.  Otherwise, you call will fall into a black hole.  By asking for a call back you are ensuring that the NHPD will take action and then be held accountable to you for what action is taken.\r\n\r\nWe need enough people to report these illegal machines, call the police, and work with their NHPD district managers.  There are 100,000 of us in this city and only 100 or so of these dirt bike and ATV riders who are ruining our quality of life.  We all need to raise this issue with our police and city government.

They were very suspicious.  I had a feeling something bad was going to happen. I called the NHPD main number and got a recording several times. I then called 911 and gave a detailoed description. In the meantime a neighbor came outside because he saw the way the man was being followed. I watched the man being followed to the area near Brook Hollow. My neighbor got in his car to go to the man. Before he got there the man was punched in the face. The kids took off when my neughbor stopped his car and called out to the man ewho was bleeding ptofusely and asked my neighbor to call police. He got the same recording. My neighbor saw assailants run up to Oak Ridge projects. Another man came and was talking to the injured man who was dazes. My neighbor asked me to call police again. The bottom line is that there was another incident at 1363 Quinnipiac Ave as a relitive who nears near by told me. After waiting a half hour my neighbor and I went to 1363 Quinnipiac to report what we saw. The officers in car 90 refused to take a statement about what we saw saying that the elderly man had to call first. Even though we could ID the kids who assaulted a senior citizen we were blown off. So if the old man is scared or disoriented and doesn't call police these punks got away with it. So much for the NHPD telling people to report crime.

Your administration has done nothing to help out with the snow removal in this city. People from your office post here that they are constantly working on the issue, but all I have seen is a plow going down streets from time to time, pushing all the snow up next to parked cars, blocking them in. Driving, biking, and walking in this city has become a nightmare. On Orange close to the housing authority, there has been a large mound of snow blocking part of the northbound lane for two weeks now, forcing cars in that lane to use the southbound lane. Pearl and Eld, used by a lot of people trying to get to and from Orange and State, are an absolute disaster because people cannot park easily and leave the front or back ends of their cars out in the streets. Emergency personal have said that in many of the East Rock streets it is literally impossible for an ambulance or a fire truck to fit. Humphrey is an accident waiting to happen, considering how blocked it has become and how quickly people try to drive on it. And it's not just the East Rock neighborhood -- it's everywhere. You have taken little to no action on this issue, and you have proven yourself a disgrace. You make few public appearances, and people complain constantly that they never see you or know what you are up to. You are a failure of a mayor, and your response to this issue, despite the constant outcries from the people, has been to ignore it. The former mayor figured out what to do when there was a mess left after a huge snowstorm, so why can't you?

So: two new stop signs should be installed, replacing the “YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS” signs that are currently there and that are currently ignored. The crosswalk-sign that stays in the middle of the crosswalk until it is hit and destroyed by a car should be installed properly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there should be crosswalks painted on all sides of the intersection; as is, only the northern crossing is painted.

Division Street\nNew Haven, CT  06511\n(203)901-3529\nWednesday, January 14, 2015\n\n\nMr. Michael Carter, Acting Director\nCity Of New Haven (Department of Public Works)\n34 Middletown Avenue\nNew Haven, CT  06513\n203-946-7700\n\nReference:  Side Walk & Driveway\n\nGreetings;\n\nIn April of 2012 I purchased a home at 339-341 W. Division Street in New Haven.  I love my home but getting in and out of my Driveway is a major job.  The first thing is that the Driveway is very narrow and the second issue; is that my neighbors across the street who has a much wider Driveway, has five to six cars which parks along one side of the street even blocking their own Driveway.  This makes it very hard for me and my family to pull in, pull out, back in and back out if my Driveway on a regular bases. I can’t even pull out of my Driveway if they have their driver side car doors open.  I have to wait on them which happen a lot.   West Division Street is already a one way street and a bit of a tight street. I’m seeking your help, assistance and/or advice in this matter.\n\nNow, last but not least I purchase the corner lot property which is W. Division Street and Sherman Pkwy.  I’m suggesting and seeking to move my Driveway on the side of my property to avoid the whole issue with my neighbors and the inconvenience of the whole matter.  This will also allow me to enter and exit my property on a two way street a well.  \n\nThere is no sidewalk on the Sherman Pkwy.  I was under the impression that a Sidewalk was going to be placed a while ago after speaking with Neighborhood Housing Services.  Also, seeing how the fence went down and the trees came up across the street on Sherman Pkwy, I assumed it would be part of the beautification process.  I could be mistaken and if so I’m seeking your help in trying to get a side walk placed on the side of my property which has a high traffic rate/usage.   Children take the rout every day for the school bus and going to and from school each day along residents and not to forget that when the parking runs out at James Hillhouse High School for the various events that is hosted the area in questioned is used quite a bit.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on his matter.  Please feel free to contact me on the number listed above.  I thank you in advance for all of your help, understanding and cooperation.  \n\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\n\n\nLillieadair Chambers,\nConcerned New Haven Resident\n"", ""probability"" : 0.6654694759022818, ""label"" : ""Sidewalk & Curb Damage"" }",

While it is frustrating to witness multiple times on a daily basis blatant disregard for basic traffic laws by citizens, I am especially alarmed when I witness City employees (presumably) in City vehicles driving in such a way. Today at 4pm as I approached the crosswalk of Nicoll and Lawrence, a City Park and Rec light green Ford Escape approached the intersection from the southeast and quite literally blew through the intersection and made a right turn onto Nicoll. This was done while accelerating and without any consideration for the stop sign nor pedestrian safety. The vehicle entered the opposing lane of traffic as it sped down Nicoll at a speed obviously greater than the speed limit. Again, this happened as I was about to enter the crosswalk and I cannot provide a description of the driver bc the vehicle was moving just that fast. I don't want to sound like a curmudgeon, as I'm in my 30s, but having been an employee of state and federal gov't in the past, and being an overall concerned citizen for  the pedestrians in New Haven (i.e. two pedestrians were killed just LAST week), I think this issue should be brought to the attention of the Park and Rec Dept and the driver should be reminded of his/her responsibility to only not injure pedestrians, but to represent the gov't and city with a better image than he/she did.

On his way to Lighthouse with 6 people on board, he stopped in front of me while I was doing yard work and did some type of hand gesture.  The riders seem perplexed and clearly noted his behavior.  There is no bus stop in front of my house.  No one got off or on the bus at that point.  On his return trip, no riders but in front on my neighbor, I did not make eye contact with him so he beeped his horn until I looked at him.  I would like a written response that you have spoken to this driver specifically.  I would appreciate a written apology from the driver.  If you need to speak to my neighbor, please let me know.  If he harasses me again, I will want to meet with you so that it becomes a permanent part of his job performance record.  \r\n\r\nI will not be harassed by a state/municipal employee.  I have asked the bus drivers to slow down.  The speed limit is 25.  They are often going well over 35.  They drive down the middle of the road over the yellow lines and do not make a clear stop at the nearby stop sign.  \r\n\r\nThat said there are at least 2 women drivers who do obey all of the laws.  I will be sure to get their numbers so they can receive the recognition.\r\n\r\nThis has gone from asking you through several complaint forms to slow your buses down before they hurt a pedestrian, bicyclist or families on their walk.  This is a residential neighborhood.  But to go from being ignored to being harassed is one step past breaking the traffic laws.\r\n\r\nAlso as a separate issue, there is no bus stop in front of my house but drivers have been picking up passengers there.

The path from Old Campus Quad to Harkness Tower fails to meet that definition.. Although the BOA was foolish enough to sell the rest of High Street, this portion still remains public property and should not be commandeered by the University.\n\nIssue: Yale has also taken it upon themselves to tamp a large pile of asphalt on the Harkness side of the street sloping from street to sidewalk. Although this resembled a handicap ramp, it fails to actually meet the ADA definition, is the inversion of a curb cut extending out into the street and therefore puts vehicles in grave danger.

The problem is with all that redesigning no one ever thought to put in a signal that recognizes cyclists. If you get stuck at that light without a car behind you to signal the dedicated left turn the \""on demand\"" signal never changes, and you get stranded in the middle of a fast, busy, dangerous state road. I should point out that this is a heavily used cyclist route and is part of many rides in the greater New Haven area. Can we please install new technology--or properly calibrate the existing infrastructure-- so that it will sense lone cyclists waiting at this left turn signal. Thank you.

Over front exterior entrance to 2nd floor, ends of said molding merely were filled with expanding foam, still allowing entrance of birds, squirrels, insects and water—but  not repaired; \r\n•\trotted, split eave boards under 2nd floor front windows (of said overhang between 1st and 2nd floor) \r\n•\tAforementioned split eave boards contain a massive wasp nest, such that tenants on 2nd floor cannot open front windows in summer; \r\n•\tRotted, split eave of this same overhang “repaired” with expanding foam: where it terminates on right side/Greenwich Ave. side of building\r\n•\tRotted top-trim [lintel boards] over BOTH small windows on left, 1st floor side of building\r\n•\tnew plywood eave that was added to left side of building [after original collapsed, along with much of the roof,  into neighbor’s driveway] was NOT completed at front corner: it does not meet properly with the eave return\r\n•\tthis entire new eave—illegally installed by unlicensed contractor—was   attached with drywall screws rather than exterior-grade fasteners—and therefore is likely to collapse again soon; it also has not been painted or covered with siding to protect this new eave from weather damage; \r\n•\tthis same new plywood eave and facia on left side of building already is water-stained at joints due to water infiltration: likely caused both by lack of gutter maintenance as well as incompetently installed new roof\r\n•\tgutters not maintained: overflow when raining, because they never have been cleaned. As noted above, this also is damaging eave and facia\r\n•\tRotted eave returns on the front of building were “repaired” in slap-dash manner by unlicensed—i.e. illegal—contractor ; they were not “continued” properly where they meet the side eaves; and both “returns” are about to collapse due to contractor’s incompetence: they are barely secured to the building! This is an IMMEDIATE  hazard to pedestrians and tenants\r\n•\t“building contains unauthorized storage or accumulation of junk, trash, rubbish, litter or refuse”: behind and in front of the garages\r\n•\tThe rotted door at top of rear, exterior stairway is an INterior-grade lauan door—not rated for exterior use. This creates an immediate security problem for tenants—and is a fire hazard.\r\n•\tmany exterior clapboards are split, shedding paint [lead paint?] everywhere and allowing water infiltration; the most-heavily damaged clapboards are on left side of building; this is causing structural damage/rot to building’s sill and framing and is adding to persistent mold problem inside apartments; inspector needs to examine sill from inside basement. ***HOUSING COURT and LCI should NOT resolve tenant’s mold and dampness complaint [see below] until this is resolved. *** Otherwise mold remediation in apartment only will be very temporary.\r\n•\tmold and algae are on window sills at building’s left side—due  to malfunctioning gutters and general lack of maintenance \r\n•\tbirds are nesting inside furnace air-intake vents on left side of building, due to lack of  guards here to keep out birds/rodents; this is a carbon monoxide hazard!\r\n•\tPlywood siding is rotted under concrete roof edge at REAR of brick/cinderblock addition (between garage and wood frame part of building): i.e. along rear, exterior wood stairway\r\n•\thuge pile of dry leaves under rear, exterior wood stairway—creating immediate fire hazard\r\n•\trotted trim where wood of building abuts concrete sidewalk, at the angled, corner doorway of 1st floor unit numbered “371” [Greenwich] \r\n•\t“It is a fire hazard as determined by the fire marshal, or as documented in fire department reports.” About 10 days ago members of the New Haven Fire Dept. spent considerable time photographing the exterior of this building. I suspect they have a report which LCI can access.\r\nOwner Kirsten Hopes-McFadden (and “agent”/spouse Tillman “Tim” McFadden) of North Haven were ordered by LCI to fix numerous problems with 2nd floor apartment of 86 Second ST. back in Oct, 2013; they were re-ordered in Feb, 2014—and finally had to be taken to Housing Court this month by the tenant to commence repairs. \r\n***WHY DID LCI allow the problem to drag out so long that the tenant had no recourse but to bypass LCI—and go to Housing Court for repairs to commence??***\r\n“blighted lots and buildings adversely affect the city's economic well-being, and are inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents…It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds [i.e. taxpayers money!] to correct and eliminate the same.” (from Anti-blight and property maintenance ordinance; . Declaration of Policy*)\r\nIt is part of LCI’s responsibilities to ENFORCE the Anti-blight ordinance. It is my hope that neighbors will not need to turn to the courts—as the tenant did—in order to get LCI to carry out its responsibilities as they relate to 86 Second Street. \r\nADDITIONALLY, due to owner’s persistent history of hiring incompetent, unlicensed, illegal contractors to perform hazardous, makeshift repairs, LCI needs to INSIST that above-mentioned problems be repaired by a state-licensed, insured contractor—as is required by CT state law. And LCI should insist on PROOF of said licensure and insurance by the contractor. It is ILLEGAL in the state of CT for contractors to be working without licensure: http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?q=274440 Note that Building officials are prohibited from issuing building permits unless they receive a copy of the contractor’s valid Certificate of Registration http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=4308&q=507962\r\n(or Google “Connecticut department of consumer protection”) \r\n* New Haven, Connecticut, Code of Ordinances >> TITLE III - CODE OF GENERAL ORDINANCES >> Chapter 9 - BUILDINGS AND PROPERTY >> ARTICLE II.

Here are just a few. To resolve this issue, Yale, the Lincoln-Bradley Neighborhood association, the City of New Haven, and the landlords at 516-518 Orange and the building housing Cafe Romeo are going to need to work together. The LBNA has, in good faith, spent some time coming up with proposals for Pearl Street, none of which have stuck. I had hoped that when Yale was working to complete Evans Hall (new SOM building) they would have paid some attention to this wasp's nest of issues....but they didn't. \r\n\r\n1) the pathway from the back of Evans Hall empties directly into the middle of a city street with NO signage or indicators that pedestrians are now walking on a street. There should be bollards, a large sign and some kind of curb with a curb cut indicating that PEOPLE ARE WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET. As it is now, there is a steady stream of students pouring onto Pearl St, oblivious to their surroundings talking on their phones etc. YALE - please pay attention!!!!!! You spent over a hundred million dollars on this building and it would be a shame to have one of your students injured or killed here. Also, THERE IS NO SIDEWALK ON THIS STRETCH OF PEARL STREET.\r\n\r\n2) 516-518 Orange Street continues to be a mess.\r\n\r\na) their dumpsters overflow and are frequently end up in the middle of the sidewalk - they have tried to improve this situation, but it is still far from being a good situation.\r\n\r\nb) the portion on the (too narrow) sidewalk on Pearl Street that they are responsible for cleaning is a sheet of ice. Even on the best days, this sidewalk is dangerous. The concrete is cracked and the strip of dirt between the sidewalk and the curb is usually full of broken glass and garbage that hasnt been picked up by the trash company\r\n\r\n3) the parking area on Pearl Street adjacent to Cafe Romeo's storage locker is overcrowded and usually has one or two extra cars trying to park along the north side of the street, decreasing the already tight passage on a two way street.\r\n\r\n4) Delivery trucks (the SYSCO truck, which is an 18-wheeler is a particular offender) for Romeo's frequently double park on this same narrow portion of street.\r\n\r\n5) The parking on Orange Street north of the intersection with Pearl creates a hazard for cars driving east on Pearl, trying to cross. It is impossible to see oncoming traffic, and the cars driving south on Orange cannot see cars exiting Pearl Street.\r\n\r\n6) Drivers frequently use Lincoln Street as a shortcut around the traffic that backs up from the light at Orange and Trumbull and the ensuing bottleneck from the narrowing of Orange Street between Pearl and Eld.

As a result of public input received during the fare increase process, some of the proposed fare increases were reduced and transfer policies have been improved.\r\n\r\nWith the new fare structure, a one-way cash fare for CTTRANSIT local bus service will increase from $1.30 to $1.50. One-way ADA Paratransit service will increase to $3.00, and ADA Paratransit 10-trip books will cost $24.00. For express bus passengers who use flash passes instead of a 31-day pass, the fare increase will be effective for the month of February 2014.\r\n\r\nWhile most fares are rising, some fares will decrease in price. A local bus one-day unlimited ride pass will decrease to $3.00, or the cost of just one round trip fare. The three-day pass will also see a slight decrease in price.\r\n\r\nAlso effective on January 19, 2014, the length of time for transfers will increase from ninety minutes to two hours. Transfers will be valid for unlimited rides on local CTTRANSIT buses going in any direction for two hours from the time issued. A transfer is issued upon request when the fare is paid upon boarding the bus.\r\n\r\n\""We realize that it is a difficult time to raise fares,\"" said CT DOT Commissioner James Redeker, noting that the Department has held the line on fares since January 2012, which was the first increase in seven years. \""Unfortunately operating expenses dictate the need to raise fares to maintain the current level of service. We've done our best to moderate the impact on our riders by listening to the feedback gathered during the public comment process.\""\r\n\r\nThe new fare structure will retain discounted rates for seniors, youth, and people with disabilities. The new fare structure is attached as part of this news release.\r\n\r\nCTTRANSIT is the state-owned bus transit system serving the greater Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, New Britain, Meriden, Bristol and Wallingford areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor More Information: http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?A=1373&Q=536600 \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Detailed fare information.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPowered by Translate\r\n PDF Usage | Privacy Policy | Resources | Title VI Policy\t\r\n\r\n\tCTTRANSIT, 100 Leibert Road, P.O.

Many students and parents are fearful that the city/school policy of requiring students to traverse this dangerously isolated trail in order to participate in their school sports events could end in more tragedy. Some scared girls would rather risk getting hit by a car by walking on curvy English Drive just to avoid the trail. The school offers no transportation or protection to & from the daily practices and home games for both the girls and boys sports teams that have to use Rice Field. I physically checked again yesterday and the students are still completely unmonitored and unescorted. Some travel in groups and some arrive from other schools to play and still have walk alone and unprotected.\n\nOur thinking is that short of an escort or some form of official transportation, the students remain exposed to the myriad dangers that this path to Rice Field presents. At minimum, the route should be monitored by either a school guard/official or a NHPD bicycle patrol during the time frame in which it is necessary for our students to travel it.* This seems a small concession given the area's troubled history and the fact that these are adolescents including females, some as young as fourteen years old, that are expected to navigate this deceptively dangerous and isolated place.\n\nFuture incidents are completely preventable. We're sure there are other ideas on how to stop this from ever happening again and we're interested in hearing them...one question we have is why is Cross unable or unwilling to schedule sharing their on-site football field and/or complex with soccer teams like most other High Schools?\n\nAgain, your attention to the matter is very, very much appreciated. Please keep us informed of any developments here.\n\n*Cross generally gets out at 2:00 and students start walking from the school, down Orange St. to Rice Field at about 2:15 for daily practice or pre home game warm ups (games start at 3:45 and end at about 6 when some students walk back on the trail)\n\nContacts: WCHS PRINCIPAL: <edith.johnson@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' Superintendent: <garth.harries@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' SECURITY: <dwight.ware@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' Transportation: <teddi.barra@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nSincerely, concerned Parents and Taxpayers "", ""probability"" : 0.6825746376699237, ""label"" : ""Traffic, Road Safety & Noisy Vehicles"" }",

First let’s start how if you are heading towards Southern on Ella Grasso Blvd., there NEEDS to be a designated “left turn” lane at Ella Grasso Blvd and a designated “right turn/straight” lane at this same intersection. I don’t know how many times I have been cut off by other drivers because you have drivers that stay on the right side that go straight and cut you off, or if you are on the right side to go straight, you have drivers on the left side that go straight to cut you off. Confusing….right? I know. Which is why there needs to be these designated lanes to go in certain directions. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, any way we can make the light green longer that faces Ella Grasso Blvd. in BOTH directions? Seriously, the light is green for no more than a minute, and traffic gets backed up during rush hour in the morning and in the evening. \r\n\r\nPerhaps to get a better understanding on how annoying this intersection is, not to mention the problems of this intersection, I am wondering if someone from the traffic division can observe this intersection during rush hour commute (whether in morning or in the evening). I am fully aware that New Haven has other bigger issues, and the personnel of the police department has bigger things to deal with, but it’s a matter of time before a serious accident happens. So many people are cutting people off and/or running the light because it’s too short and people get impatient for waiting at the light for the fifth time in a row. As stated earlier, I have been cut off numerous times, and almost to the point where people were inches away from hitting me head on due to them running the light if they are making a left turn onto Whalley. SOMETHING needs to be done, and any effort to get this problem solved would be greatly appreciated. \r\n"", ""probability"" : 0.9944304963486904, ""label"" : ""Traffic, Road Safety & Noisy Vehicles"" }",

Narrowing the travel lanes by reducing pedestrian crossing distances would be one of the most effective ways to permanently reduce speeds. The city could also consider raised intersections and roundabouts, as they have in other neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nChris Heitmann wrote:\r\n\r\nCars don’t look like that when crashing at 25mph, which is what the posted speed limit is here and throughout New Haven. On neighborhood streets like Central and Willard, it arguably should be slower, more like 20mph. While the NHPD has done an excellent job of stepping up traffic enforcement in the neighborhood, enforcement will only get us so far. Similarly with education: it’s needed, but will have a very limited impact (no pun intended). The third “E” - Engineering - is where the city can really improve safety here. As Pedro suggests, this intersection is an excellent candidate for a small roundabout (not as big as on West Park, for which there’s no room here). Other alternatives would be bumping out the sidewalk at all four corners, thus narrowing the street and reducing crossing distances, raised crosswalks, and/or pedestrian refuges/planted medians leading into the intersection. The city needs to really study what the BEST solution would be here, and to consult with neighbors throughout. My concern with the idea of another traffic light is that cars would arguably speed more in order to make the light. The solution needs to SLOW PEOPLE DOWN, which would make this safer for cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and the kids who cross and wait here for the school bus every morning.\r\n\r\nThank goodness no one was seriously hurt yesterday and that no pedestrians or cyclists without 3000 pounds of steel to product them were in the intersection when this happened. A big thank you to the NHFD for a job well done and to the Independent for bringing attention to this sadly ongoing yet preventable issue.\r\n\r\nA few other residents wrote:\r\n\r\n- I live a few houses down on Willard, and that intersection is horrible. You have to pull out almost into the middle of Central to see past the street parking, and people fly up and down Central. It’s the only big intersection in the area without a 4 way stop.\r\n\r\n- I was almost involved in a serious accident in high school right at this intersection. A guy in a Camaro was flying down central, and I pulled out from willard not seeing him (since he was so far down the street) and he slammed his brakes hard and just missed me.  While I was the “cause” of him stopping, it was the fact that he was going about 60 down central that would have caused the accident.\r\n\r\n- Central is a nice long straight run through Westville and people use it as a speedway to cross over New Haven all the time since it links Rt 34 to Whalley. The minimal cost of stop signs at all of the unsignaled intersections would greatly reduce the speeds on this street.\r\n\r\n- Thank God no one was killed last night. That is without question one of THE WORST intersections in New Haven. Speed on Central Ave combined with poor visibility from Willard is a recipe for casualties.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/grand_am/\r\n"", ""probability"" : 0.9949809290387255, ""label"" : ""Traffic, Road Safety & Noisy Vehicles"" }",

Driving or walking by, the foul odor can be overwhelming, and even blocks away, the fumes invade. The potential \""danger\"" of these emissions is a serious concern, compounded by the  billowing black smoke recently seen billowing from the factory, as well as the company's disturbing history of air pollution.\r\n\r\n“’The smell would drive you crazy,’ said Louis Lopez, a 44-year-old mechanic who has worked for Uretek since 1984.” In December 1986, The New York Times covered a controversial employee strike at Uretek Inc. Uretek workers walked off the job due to health and safety concerns, specifically regarding the solvent dimethylformamide, or DMF, which is used at the plant. They claimed that fumes sickened half of the 66 workers at the plant. Later, testing by Yale confirmed the damage: 36 of the tested employees had ''significant liver-function abnormalities,'' and ten were diagnosed with toxic hepatitis, findings that, according to the doctor, were ''overwhelmingly'' linked to DMF*\r\n\r\nThe workers’ health problems in 1986 were “not the first time that Uretek has been accused of wrongdoing,” according to the Times article. In 1984, the Uretek vice president John Andrews was convicted on felony charges of illegally storing and disposing of hazardous waste – making it “the first time a corporation in Connecticut had been convicted of such a criminal offense in a trial.”\r\n\r\nThe article also noted that Uretek has been cited by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on air pollution.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was many years ago, Uretek's emissions and its potential impact on the environment and people remain a very significant concern.\r\n\r\nThe DEP was notified a few years back (when the odors seemed particularly strong and noxious even blocks away). Despite Uretek’s pollution history, DEP’s response seemed disinterested. As far as we know, no air quality testing was conducted, nor any follow-up. \r\n\r\nA health issue as serious and dangerous as this requires more than discussions or assurances from factory management. It would seem logical and imperative that thorough air quality testing be conducted (especially after hours/at night when the odors are often strongest) and that the results be made publicly available.\r\n\r\nDoes DEP receive notification of SeeClickFix concerns? \r\n\r\n"", ""probability"" : 0.3687418833200245, ""label"" : ""Traffic, Road Safety & Noisy Vehicles"" }",

We noticed the police department continues to bill the tax payers, yet are not providing even the very basic services that a police department is expected to provide. Crime is out of control; people are constantly shooting people and being shot, violence in general is beyond scary, and all other gang crime and drug crimes are becoming far too common and committed in the open. Traffic violations are out of control; there are speeding cars everywhere, basic traffic rules are disregarded by almost everyone, and people committing more serious offenses like running red lights and stops signs occur at a frequency that is beyond appalling. Quality of life issues are out of control; the list is so long and everyone knows it. \r\n\r\nWhy don't you start by pulling people over for basic offenses like: no brake lights, headlights out, cracked windshields, missing plates, expired plates, tinted windows, loud mufflers, and loud music. If they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. I guarantee the results of following these very basic procedures will be noticed by ALL the City of New Haven residents and its out of town visitors. The people who value life and want a decent quality of life will be very appreciative. \r\n\r\nYou say you cannot because you are undermanned/understaffed. Not true. You need to restructure your department. It is as simple as that. You also need to get your priorities straight. Why do we see countless officers all over town watching construction workers doing their jobs? Or, directing traffic like a flagman, at best? You say safety. Not true. Why not hire a real flagger who has been trained? Half the time these officers are sitting in their cars talking on their cell phones. Lately, we have seen not one cop at each construction site, but two, usually sitting around talking and not paying attention. All of these officers could, and SHOULD, be driving around pulling people over for the above mentioned quality of life and traffic offenses. Simple as that. Again, if they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. The procedure is simple and effective and has years of use behind it to back up its effectiveness. \r\n\r\nIf you follow this simple plan that I have spelled out above (it doesn't require much brain matter), it is certain that this little town of 124,000 people can return to some degree of normalcy before the summer really gets going.

Drivers routinely speed on residential Barnett St. between Willard and Fountain. Much of this is cut-through traffic trying to avoid the light at Fountain St.   and Forest Rd. While cut-through traffic in and of itself is arguably OK, the speeding is not. Beside the traffic noise of fast-moving cars (often 40-45 mph), there are about a dozen kids under the age of 7 just on the half-block closest to Willard - and lots more in a one-block radius - that routinely play near the street. This is a serious safety and quality of life issue. \r\n\r\nA few possible solutions to slow people down would be:\r\n1) Install two nice big asphalt speed humps (rather than speed bumps, which are shorter and can be very loud when cars pass over). Speed humps do not cost  a lot and work very well in substantially lowering speeds - it's an easy fix for the speeding and would probably also help cut down on the cut-through traffic. The only downside as far as I can tell is that snowplows and in-street bicyclists have to get used to them. See photo.\r\nOR\r\n2) Alternate street parking from one side to the other once or twice down the block, and bump-out or stripe the transitions with chicanes. The bump-outs could create some nice new planting areas, which neighbors on this block would likely and gladly take on maintenance of. Building them is relatively expensive b/c of the curbing, but they could be striped first as a cheap experiment. See photo in next post.\r\nOR\r\n3) Just allow cars to park on both sides of Barnett, creating what's called a \""queuing street\"" - cars have to pull over and wait to pass one another. This latter approach is a new standard for low-volume residential streets in Portland, OR and is the defacto standard on older streets all over the world. This would be cheapest - just some new parking signs. Barnett is roughly 27' wide, just between the 26-28' wide standard for a two-sided parking queuing street. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing other possible solutions.
