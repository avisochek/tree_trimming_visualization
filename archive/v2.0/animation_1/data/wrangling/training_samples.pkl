VDirtbikes and Quads Tear Through Neighborhood in front of Cop
p24
aVI just witnessed about a dozen people on dirtbikes and quads tear through our neighborhood directly in front of a police car. The office hit his siren once and followed ambivalently as they sped away against traffic, on sidewalks, nearly causing an accident at the corner of Winthrop and Chapel. You could still hear them a minute later, presumably all the way to Whalley. This is out of f'in control and ridiculous! How is it our police force cant stop a bunch of idiot teenagers riding around on these things? Someones going to get really hurt one day when they cause an accident or lose control of their ride. I think its time for the police to reexamine their "no chase" policy, clearly relationship building and stakeouts aren't working. It's only June and this issue is out of hand, worse than its been in previous years. Cant we basically just station officers at all the major intersections in the neighborhoods they like to frequent and blockade them in, then arrest and seize the bikes/ quads? Something else needs to be done.

VLate Night Red Lights for Pedestrians
p89
aVEver notice how New Haven traffic lights (not just this one, other lights such as at Temple and Crown do this as well) continue to have a four-way red to allow pedestrians to cross in all directions?  This makes sense during the day, when there are a lot of pedestrians, but it is pointless past midnight certainly during the week and past 2am on weekends.  It is really annoying to get stuck at a light for 30 seconds with a four-way walk sign flashing and zero pedestrians anywhere in sight while driving home late.  There must be a way to have a daytime pattern and a nighttime pattern.

aVPossibly the worst Connecticut Department of "Transportation" blunder ever?  The redo of this intersection created horrible traffic backups onto Sea St., extending as far back as Howard Ave. and 6th Street.\u000aIn addition, the multiple turn lanes, signal lights, confusing signs and crazy road striping appear designed to confuse drivers.  I have witnessed several near head-on collisions from Southbound Blvd. traffic attempting to enter this octopus of an intersection.  The pedestrian infrastructure is a joke too.\u000aCT DOT forget about your little lines of paint; no one pays attention to them anyway.  Please install some hardscape, that is, islands with curbs to slow and direct traffic.  Millions of dollars spent and the end result is massive traffic jams and delays, on Sea St. and Howard Ave., car wrecks and destruction of property values in the historic City Point neighborhood.

aVA car is parked in front of our home, on the ODD side of the street, which is in direct violation of the Mayor's orders, thus preventing a proper snow removal from the City, which then leaves a snow pile in front of our home that lasts for weeks, and THAT prevents us from parking in front of our home (where an elderly woman lives), once the snow ban is lifted. This issue happens every year, because cars don't think that they will be towed, because they aren't, and so they continue to park "against emergency orders".  Last year a van parked in front of our home for 4 weeks, completely snow and ice packed, and I notified the proper departments, but the issue continued, and an elderly family member fell on the hazardous conditions caused by the "illegally parked van, the snow, and the ice issues" caused by the van.  I certainly would NOT like to see someone get towed, because they did not move their vehicle, but if everyone is expected to follow the rules, then THAT helps everyone in the long run.  Thank you.

It is my understanding it is a State Tree and based on my experience with the agency I doubt anything will be done.  I decided to inform you so I can have proof of my reporting since it seems that nobody wants to take responsability because according to Mr. Barnes what comes to my property it is my responsability.
