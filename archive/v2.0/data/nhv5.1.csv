 As I understand things, the parking lot, as part of The Strong School, is owned by the City. The City does not seem interested in either following up on development proposals for the school/lot or regularly maintaing it in the meantime. Unfortunately the people that park there dump a lot of garbage. Perhaps someone in the City government could look at the larger picture in this case and assign an agency with appropriate resources to deal with this. It would also be nice if the City moved on The Strong School proposal. Grand Avenue has been designated as a vital area for futher develop has it not.

Some trash recepticles aound the parking area might be a good idea.

There are still a lot of larger items dumped in the lot.  It would require a truck and people that can do some heavy lifting to remove them. Someone please do this.

I took the picture today after picking up three grocery bags of garbage that was scattered around the overflowing garbage can, which included household stuff people had sort of draped on top.
So can the City of New Haven make it a point to drive up East Rock and empty garbage cans at least every day, especially given the fact that people enjoy going up there when the weather is nice -- and the weather has been nice. Also, when the garbage cans get full, raccoons get into the cans and trash gets everywhere. Also, some of the people who visit East Rock aren't too particular about where they put their garbage so if the garbage can is empty, they're slightly less likely to just throw it on the ground.

They were very suspicious.  I had a feeling something bad was going to happen. I called the NHPD main number and got a recording several times. I then called 911 and gave a detailoed description. In the meantime a neighbor came outside because he saw the way the man was being followed. I watched the man being followed to the area near Brook Hollow. My neighbor got in his car to go to the man. Before he got there the man was punched in the face. The kids took off when my neughbor stopped his car and called out to the man ewho was bleeding ptofusely and asked my neighbor to call police. He got the same recording. My neighbor saw assailants run up to Oak Ridge projects. Another man came and was talking to the injured man who was dazes. My neighbor asked me to call police again. The bottom line is that there was another incident at 1363 Quinnipiac Ave as a relitive who nears near by told me. After waiting a half hour my neighbor and I went to 1363 Quinnipiac to report what we saw. The officers in car 90 refused to take a statement about what we saw saying that the elderly man had to call first. Even though we could ID the kids who assaulted a senior citizen we were blown off. So if the old man is scared or disoriented and doesn't call police these punks got away with it. So much for the NHPD telling people to report crime. I am a block watch captain and telling people that if 4 young black kids, one with reish-brown hair, one wearing red sneakers, one wearing red sneakers and one wearing blure or grey sneakkers with an orangish color around the ankles and approached you and asks if you have a phone or follows you, go to the nearest safe place and call police.

In addition, the multiple turn lanes, signal lights, confusing signs and crazy road striping appear designed to confuse drivers.  I have witnessed several near head-on collisions from Southbound Blvd. traffic attempting to enter this octopus of an intersection.  The pedestrian infrastructure is a joke too.
CT DOT forget about your little lines of paint; no one pays attention to them anyway.  Please install some hardscape, that is, islands with curbs to slow and direct traffic.  Millions of dollars spent and the end result is massive traffic jams and delays, on Sea St. and Howard Ave., car wrecks and destruction of property values in the historic City Point neighborhood.",,"Ella T Grasso Boulevard New Haven, Connecticut","Traffic/Road Safety",,"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1612032/comments","Traffic & Road Safety","NA"

The city continues to complain about not having enough money to plow the roads (a whole 'nother issue itself) - Well guess what New Haven - THERE ARE PLENTY OF LANDOWNERS WHO HAVEN'T CLEARED THEIR SIDEWALKS AS PER CITY RULES: FINE THEM! This is the only way to get people to become responsible for their properties - give them incentive to clear their sidewalks. I have fallen THREE times in the last 1.5 weeks, and it wasn't for lack of proper shoes. 

The areas surrounding Humphrey street are impassable - I should've just worn ice skates this morning trying to walk down Orange st. Part of the problem of course are the mountain heaps of snow/ice on the sidewalks that are preventing draining of melting snow. 

Your citizens are @#$%, New Haven. Where the HECK are our tax dollars going? If you're hurting for money, start being freaking pro-active and enforce your own statutes - with all the fine money you'd get, maybe you could start doing something about the dang budget.

Your administration has done nothing to help out with the snow removal in this city. People from your office post here that they are constantly working on the issue, but all I have seen is a plow going down streets from time to time, pushing all the snow up next to parked cars, blocking them in. Driving, biking, and walking in this city has become a nightmare. On Orange close to the housing authority, there has been a large mound of snow blocking part of the northbound lane for two weeks now, forcing cars in that lane to use the southbound lane. Pearl and Eld, used by a lot of people trying to get to and from Orange and State, are an absolute disaster because people cannot park easily and leave the front or back ends of their cars out in the streets. Emergency personal have said that in many of the East Rock streets it is literally impossible for an ambulance or a fire truck to fit. Humphrey is an accident waiting to happen, considering how blocked it has become and how quickly people try to drive on it. And it's not just the East Rock neighborhood -- it's everywhere. You have taken little to no action on this issue, and you have proven yourself a disgrace. You make few public appearances, and people complain constantly that they never see you or know what you are up to. You are a failure of a mayor, and your response to this issue, despite the constant outcries from the people, has been to ignore it. The former mayor figured out what to do when there was a mess left after a huge snowstorm, so why can't you? Now that some of this is thawing, the streets and sidewalks are inches deep in water in places, and tonight they will turn into an ice skating rink.

Many of us only have street parking and we're doing our best to find legal parking spaces and park as close to the curb as possible, but even on the odd side (which is where my car was), which is supposed to be plowed by the city, you have to park on a mountain of snow to get close to the curb. Cars can barely get down the street (made more narrow by the snow), so situations like mine are bound to happen.

The damage to my car is almost 3k and there was no note or effort made to contact me. The city needs to take better care of its residents (who are paying to park on the street) so that they're not the victim of similar incidents. Mind you, I realize that these situations can happen in the summer, but the parking situation due to the snow has been really ridiculous this season and this incident was the straw that broke the camel's back.",,"Clark Street New Haven, Connecticut","SNOW RELATED",,"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1502800/comments","Snow Related","NA"

Despite all of the claims that the city of New Haven is doing a better job of snow removal this year thanks to all of their new equipment, the plan fails the eye test. 

Nothing has changed and I believe Whitney Ave is a good indication of this.  Once again commuters are forced into one lane as soon as they cross into New Haven from Hamden.  Whitney from Burns St. all the way  Edwards is a one lane road. Why hasn't the road been cleared given the fact that there is no parking allowed on the road during two periods throughout the day.

Reference:  Side Walk & Driveway

Greetings;

In April of 2012 I purchased a home at 339-341 W. Division Street in New Haven.  I love my home but getting in and out of my Driveway is a major job.  The first thing is that the Driveway is very narrow and the second issue; is that my neighbors across the street who has a much wider Driveway, has five to six cars which parks along one side of the street even blocking their own Driveway.  This makes it very hard for me and my family to pull in, pull out, back in and back out if my Driveway on a regular bases. I can’t even pull out of my Driveway if they have their driver side car doors open.  I have to wait on them which happen a lot.   West Division Street is already a one way street and a bit of a tight street. I’m seeking your help, assistance and/or advice in this matter.

Now, last but not least I purchase the corner lot property which is W. Division Street and Sherman Pkwy.  I’m suggesting and seeking to move my Driveway on the side of my property to avoid the whole issue with my neighbors and the inconvenience of the whole matter.  This will also allow me to enter and exit my property on a two way street a well.  

There is no sidewalk on the Sherman Pkwy.  I was under the impression that a Sidewalk was going to be placed a while ago after speaking with Neighborhood Housing Services.  Also, seeing how the fence went down and the trees came up across the street on Sherman Pkwy, I assumed it would be part of the beautification process.  I could be mistaken and if so I’m seeking your help in trying to get a side walk placed on the side of my property which has a high traffic rate/usage.   Children take the rout every day for the school bus and going to and from school each day along residents and not to forget that when the parking runs out at James Hillhouse High School for the various events that is hosted the area in questioned is used quite a bit.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on his matter.  Please feel free to contact me on the number listed above.  I thank you in advance for all of your help, understanding and cooperation.

I am sure at the intersection of Orange and Trumbull Streets two accidents could have been avoided were the victims going anywhere near 30.  No lives were lost. . .only injuries and property damage.

Coming into the intersection off I-91 the ramp speed has a sign for 35 mph.

The intersection has another unfortunate feature. The road surface has a drop from one level on west side of the intersection to a slightly lower elevation at the base of the on-ramp alongside Trumbull.  Add the various potholes and you have trucks bouncing through the intersection, especially their speed is excessive.

When the Fucci project completed after the sewer work, they repaved the Length of Trumbull from Prospect to Orange and across the intersection.  Smooth new pavement brings speed until you hit the rough old road and then you get noise.

Post a speed limit. . . start with 30.

Repair the road surface to quiet the traffic.

The work caused major inconvenience, from noise to a city ban on street parking, but as residents, we understood the need to be patient and the potential long-term benefits of having solid infrastructure. However, when it was time to seal the holes in the road, the construction crew did shoddy work. As a result, the road is uneven, full of poorly filled potholes, cracks and bumps. A simple slow drive to get out of the street has become a difficult and bumpy experience. Like most of my neighbors, I own a simple sedan, not an all terrain vehicle that can handle such a ride. And with small children in the back of my car, the ride has become particularly unsafe. Since Pearl St and many of its adjacent roads  - which were also badly damaged during the construction project- are one-way streets, it is practically impossible to get out of the street and into one of the main roads (e.g. State st, Orange st) without saying a prayer first. I have lived here for 3 years now, and know that the city usually repairs the roads once a year, after the winter has caused its usual damages. I also know that budget is tight. However, I can’t imagine living like this through the rest of the fall and the entire winter.

Has any consideration been given to the residents who have to back out of their driveways and  not being able to see the oncoming traffic because parked vehicles block their view, and with little room to back out because of a car or truck parked across from their driveway?

 There is a long pothole on State Street, just north of Crown Street, where a sewer separation job has turned into a trough.

In addition, every time the dumpster is over loaded with trash, the wind blows the trash to my house and we have to pick up the garbage all the time.  I have two small children and this is not safe for them either.
I spoke with the landlord once and he said he can not do anything, and wants me to find a solution.  
The lot was empty for many years before building the house and this is probably why the dumpster was moved by my fence.  I hope you can help with this issue.

• “‘Blighted’ shall mean deteriorating, in a state of ill repair, filthy or decaying….”
• “’Dilapidated’ shall mean a building or structure or part thereof that would not receive a certificate of occupancy if it were applied for…""
• Examples of both at 86 Second Street include 
•	Rotted cornice molding at front-left and rear-left corners of roof, holes in said cornice covered with scraps of metal but allowing entrance of birds and squirrels; 
•	Rotted molding of overhang, between exterior 1st floor and 2nd floor. Over front exterior entrance to 2nd floor, ends of said molding merely were filled with expanding foam, still allowing entrance of birds, squirrels, insects and water—but  not repaired; 
•	rotted, split eave boards under 2nd floor front windows (of said overhang between 1st and 2nd floor) 
•	Aforementioned split eave boards contain a massive wasp nest, such that tenants on 2nd floor cannot open front windows in summer; 
•	Rotted, split eave of this same overhang “repaired” with expanding foam: where it terminates on right side/Greenwich Ave. side of building
•	Rotted top-trim [lintel boards] over BOTH small windows on left, 1st floor side of building
•	new plywood eave that was added to left side of building [after original collapsed, along with much of the roof,  into neighbor’s driveway] was NOT completed at front corner: it does not meet properly with the eave return
•	this entire new eave—illegally installed by unlicensed contractor—was   attached with drywall screws rather than exterior-grade fasteners—and therefore is likely to collapse again soon; it also has not been painted or covered with siding to protect this new eave from weather damage; 
•	this same new plywood eave and facia on left side of building already is water-stained at joints due to water infiltration: likely caused both by lack of gutter maintenance as well as incompetently installed new roof
•	gutters not maintained: overflow when raining, because they never have been cleaned. As noted above, this also is damaging eave and facia
•	Rotted eave returns on the front of building were “repaired” in slap-dash manner by unlicensed—i.e. illegal—contractor ; they were not “continued” properly where they meet the side eaves; and both “returns” are about to collapse due to contractor’s incompetence: they are barely secured to the building! This is an IMMEDIATE  hazard to pedestrians and tenants
•	“building contains unauthorized storage or accumulation of junk, trash, rubbish, litter or refuse”: behind and in front of the garages
•	The rotted door at top of rear, exterior stairway is an INterior-grade lauan door—not rated for exterior use. This creates an immediate security problem for tenants—and is a fire hazard.
•	many exterior clapboards are split, shedding paint [lead paint?] everywhere and allowing water infiltration; the most-heavily damaged clapboards are on left side of building; this is causing structural damage/rot to building’s sill and framing and is adding to persistent mold problem inside apartments; inspector needs to examine sill from inside basement. ***HOUSING COURT and LCI should NOT resolve tenant’s mold and dampness complaint [see below] until this is resolved. *** Otherwise mold remediation in apartment only will be very temporary.
•	mold and algae are on window sills at building’s left side—due  to malfunctioning gutters and general lack of maintenance 
•	birds are nesting inside furnace air-intake vents on left side of building, due to lack of  guards here to keep out birds/rodents; this is a carbon monoxide hazard!
•	Plywood siding is rotted under concrete roof edge at REAR of brick/cinderblock addition (between garage and wood frame part of building): i.e. along rear, exterior wood stairway
•	huge pile of dry leaves under rear, exterior wood stairway—creating immediate fire hazard
•	rotted trim where wood of building abuts concrete sidewalk, at the angled, corner doorway of 1st floor unit numbered “371” [Greenwich] 
•	“It is a fire hazard as determined by the fire marshal, or as documented in fire department reports.” About 10 days ago members of the New Haven Fire Dept. spent considerable time photographing the exterior of this building. I suspect they have a report which LCI can access.
Owner Kirsten Hopes-McFadden (and “agent”/spouse Tillman “Tim” McFadden) of North Haven were ordered by LCI to fix numerous problems with 2nd floor apartment of 86 Second ST. back in Oct, 2013; they were re-ordered in Feb, 2014—and finally had to be taken to Housing Court this month by the tenant to commence repairs. 
***WHY DID LCI allow the problem to drag out so long that the tenant had no recourse but to bypass LCI—and go to Housing Court for repairs to commence??***
“blighted lots and buildings adversely affect the city's economic well-being, and are inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents…It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds [i.e. taxpayers money!] to correct and eliminate the same.” (from Anti-blight and property maintenance ordinance; . Declaration of Policy*)
It is part of LCI’s responsibilities to ENFORCE the Anti-blight ordinance. It is my hope that neighbors will not need to turn to the courts—as the tenant did—in order to get LCI to carry out its responsibilities as they relate to 86 Second Street. 
ADDITIONALLY, due to owner’s persistent history of hiring incompetent, unlicensed, illegal contractors to perform hazardous, makeshift repairs, LCI needs to INSIST that above-mentioned problems be repaired by a state-licensed, insured contractor—as is required by CT state law. And LCI should insist on PROOF of said licensure and insurance by the contractor. It is ILLEGAL in the state of CT for contractors to be working without licensure: http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?q=274440 Note that Building officials are prohibited from issuing building permits unless they receive a copy of the contractor’s valid Certificate of Registration http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=4308&q=507962

Our garage is located in the back corner of the property.  On the property directly behind our garage, 24/26 Brownell Street, there is what appears to be an abandoned utility pole.  This pole is unstable and tilting across the property line.  It is now resting on a chain link fence that runs along our property line, and is in danger of coming down and destroying our garage. My wife and I have contacted both United Illuminating and AT&T, but because there is no identifying plate on the pole, neither will claim responsibility for it.  Similarly, we have spoken to the tenants of 24/26 Brownell, but they have told us that the property is owned by an out-of-state property management company and we have been unable to get any kind of action taken by company even though the tenants assured us they would report the issue.  Surely, one of the current utility companies that conducts business in New Haven is responsible for this pole, but at this point my wife and I need help before it comes down and destroys our garage.  I have attached a recent photo that show just how perilous this situation is becoming.

The posted speed limit is 25 mph.  The buses often go well above that, particuliarly bad at night.  I have notified CT Transit about specifics on at least 50 occasions.  They send out ""supervisors"" who sit on Concord with their flashers on during the day.  They were here once at night, but the ""supervisor"" was on his screeen as buses flew by.  He did nothing.  Earlier in the day he followed a couple buses creeping down the Street.  My windows shake.  The buses use the double yellow line as a center marker for their bus.  Done.  I am asking if there are people willing to sign a petition to get them off of Concord.  And once again, I am asking NHPD to put someone down here for a period of time, giving out speeding tickets...not just you went through the stop sign tickets.  This is ridiculous.  The taxes are high and nothing gets done on this issue.  But they want to make Tweed bigger...noisier.  Done.  FIx this.  I am contacting my legislators and the Dept of Transportation.  I have given this enough of an effort, enough information and time for this to be corrected.  Perhaps speedbumps before someone gets killed.  I am told they are noisy.  Well not as noisy as a bigger airport, speeding buses and automobiles, non-stop.  Someone is going to get killed.  This is a residential street.  Not a highway.  Does it take someone getting killed?  Because there is enough documentation now that there has been a non-response.

I attach a picture of the supervisor from CT transit with his blinkers on.  The buses are slow today since he came and sits where they all can see him.

A WCHS Soccer Player was attacked on the Mill River Trail that connects Orange St. to Rice Field while walking to his soccer game last Tuesday 10/16. Many students and parents are fearful that the city/school policy of requiring students to traverse this dangerously isolated trail in order to participate in their school sports events could end in more tragedy. Some scared girls would rather risk getting hit by a car by walking on curvy English Drive just to avoid the trail. The school offers no transportation or protection to & from the daily practices and home games for both the girls and boys sports teams that have to use Rice Field. I physically checked again yesterday and the students are still completely unmonitored and unescorted. Some travel in groups and some arrive from other schools to play and still have walk alone and unprotected.

Our thinking is that short of an escort or some form of official transportation, the students remain exposed to the myriad dangers that this path to Rice Field presents. At minimum, the route should be monitored by either a school guard/official or a NHPD bicycle patrol during the time frame in which it is necessary for our students to travel it.* This seems a small concession given the area's troubled history and the fact that these are adolescents including females, some as young as fourteen years old, that are expected to navigate this deceptively dangerous and isolated place.

Future incidents are completely preventable. We're sure there are other ideas on how to stop this from ever happening again and we're interested in hearing them...one question we have is why is Cross unable or unwilling to schedule sharing their on-site football field and/or complex with soccer teams like most other High Schools?

Again, your attention to the matter is very, very much appreciated. Please keep us informed of any developments here.

*Cross generally gets out at 2:00 and students start walking from the school, down Orange St. to Rice Field at about 2:15 for daily practice or pre home game warm ups (games start at 3:45 and end at about 6 when some students walk back on the trail)

My name is Meg, and I am a frequent commuter to Southern Connecticut State University from West Haven. Every day when I go to school, I always have to cross the intersection of Whalley Ave. and Ella Grasso Blvd. 

I am writing to you to see if SOMETHING can be done about this intersection. First let’s start how if you are heading towards Southern on Ella Grasso Blvd., there NEEDS to be a designated “left turn” lane at Ella Grasso Blvd and a designated “right turn/straight” lane at this same intersection. I don’t know how many times I have been cut off by other drivers because you have drivers that stay on the right side that go straight and cut you off, or if you are on the right side to go straight, you have drivers on the left side that go straight to cut you off. Confusing….right? I know. Which is why there needs to be these designated lanes to go in certain directions. 

Furthermore, any way we can make the light green longer that faces Ella Grasso Blvd. in BOTH directions? Seriously, the light is green for no more than a minute, and traffic gets backed up during rush hour in the morning and in the evening. 

Perhaps to get a better understanding on how annoying this intersection is, not to mention the problems of this intersection, I am wondering if someone from the traffic division can observe this intersection during rush hour commute (whether in morning or in the evening). I am fully aware that New Haven has other bigger issues, and the personnel of the police department has bigger things to deal with, but it’s a matter of time before a serious accident happens. So many people are cutting people off and/or running the light because it’s too short and people get impatient for waiting at the light for the fifth time in a row. As stated earlier, I have been cut off numerous times, and almost to the point where people were inches away from hitting me head on due to them running the light if they are making a left turn onto Whalley. SOMETHING needs to be done, and any effort to get this problem solved would be greatly appreciated.

(Originally posted 12/20/09 but closed by others as ""too old."")

Reckless noisy clowns on Quads/ ATVs and dirt bikes (along with snowmobiles in the winter) have been plauging East Shore, & all over New Haven for years blasting up and down Townsend Ave. & side streets & noisily tearing up Black Rock Fort, park land & across lawns etc. 

They dangerously disobey traffic laws, running stop signs & traffic signals, zigzagging across the centerline towards oncoming traffic, cutting off cars etc.

As posted in original post, most recent dirtbike sighting was lastnight traveling down Townsend by Nathan Hale School and then back again headed towards the highway. Couldn't make out bike color in dark but rider was hefty WM with crewcut.
For what it's worth, word is one of the local East Shore riders might be the person who posts New Haven ""bikelife"" & girl-streetfight videos on YouTube like this of his taken on Ferry Street:

Now it takes an excessively *long* time for the light to turn green for James Street drivers. This is particularly problematic because there are TWO SCHOOLS on James Street right near this corner so that at drop off and pick up time, traffic-- including school buses and families picking up and dropping off-- becomes extremely backed up on James, well past Saltonstall and in front of the Martinez School.

This morning, we actually thought the light was broken as we waited, and waited, and waited on James-- the longest we have ever waited in the five years we have worked in this neighborhood.

Please, please-- is there someone from the City, Transportation, Traffic, & Parking, that can come down to see this corner *in person*? Ever since the work began here last spring with the new electric box, pedestrian cross, etc., this corner is a mess, including serious wheelchair accessibility issues as the pedestrian cross pole was put in the middle of the sidewalk.
